Using pubicly available data, make machine learning algorithm for predicting the 
likihood of having a particular disease given the symptoms that will be provided by the user

Also will suggest treatment options

Will determine the diseases based on prevalance and how many matching symptoms
  Also look into how frequently each symptom appears when someone has the disease
