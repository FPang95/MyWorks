-current data webscraped from pokebattle logs: tier, team, win/loss, pokemon down, moves used and their efficacy, total turns
and rank
-trying to figure out how to get max number of KO by one pokemon
-Also trying to import graph of move types to differentiate between attacking and non-attacking moves used
-Think of other metrics to capture
-Analysis coming up soon


June 4 2019
-increased log of battles
-added in two new columns: counts of attack and status moves per battle


June 11 2019
-Pulled pokemon used in random battles for each player
-added total move counter
-analysis track pokemon usage based on tiers to determine what teams will be faced most often
  -compare that based on rank (by 100s)

June 28 2019
-increased CSV file
-Streamlined websrape by making a separate file to store functions
-going to add pokemone typing list for own and opponents pokemon list
-for analysis, bin based on ranking (by 100s)

July 1 2019
-separated some attributes to mine and opponents
-going to add pokemone typing list for own and opponents pokemon list
-for analysis, bin based on ranking (by 100s)
-try to find way to get most pokemon ko'd by single pokemon as metric

July 4 2019
-made binning for rankings
-for anaylsis, will looks at most used pokemon by opponents in each rank 
-going to add pokemone typing list for own and opponents pokemon list
-try to find way to get most pokemon ko'd by single pokemon as metric

July 24th 2019
-Added top 10 most used pokemon and moves separated by tier
-going to add pokemone typing list for own and opponents pokemon list
-try to find way to get most pokemon ko'd by single pokemon as metric

July 27th 2019
-added more entries to CSV
-adding excel file for pokemon typing and base stats
-machine learning to predict if pokemon from random battles dictates victory
-add base stats, typing, and weaknesses in teams to CSV

July 31st 2019
-added column to CSV to grab a list of pokemon typings based on team
-will try to look for weaknesses after
-added columns for base stats (attack, defense etc) averaged based on team
  -Will use as a model to predict future outcomes
-code for functions and webscrape to grab this data off an excel file and cross reference to webscraped data

August 6, 2019
-rounded base stats values to two decimal places
-Preliminary analysis of base stats
-will try to look for weaknesses after
-idea to make a machine learning prediction model based on own team vs opponents'
  -look at base stats, rank etc
